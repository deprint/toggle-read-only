# toggle-read-only

### Make text editors read-only.

To enable read-only mode, you can:

* Execute `read-only:toggle` in the command palette.
* Click on `Toggle Read Only` in the context menu.
* Double click on the file's tab item (only when editor is not a pending tab).

You can also add file extensions in the package settings to make them read-only
when you open them.
